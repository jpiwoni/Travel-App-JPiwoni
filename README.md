# Travel-App-JPiwoni

#### Summary: I aimed to utilize some sort of API that would benefit travelers. Henceforth, I came up with the idea of using an API that correlates with the weather, that way the users can check the weather based on their travel destination. This will help users plan their trips. They will have a gist of what the weather may be like, or be able to use this when on their trip, to check the weather of the day.
